                    "description": "The latest addition to the new Marantz MusicLink series is the HD-CD1, a high-quality CD player in the same compact form as the HD-AMP1 amplifier, for which it is the perfect match. Combining more than 30 years of Marantz expertise in compact disc playback with the latest developments in digital audio technology, it's ideal for use as a CD transport when used with the HD-AMP1, or as a CD player in any situation where a compact form-factor is required without any compromise on sound quality. Small it may be, but it makes use of state-of-the-art Marantz technology carried over from our Award-winning CD players, including a high-resolution 192kHz/24-bit digital-to-analogue converter from Cirrus Logic, a high-accuracy system clock, and the famous Marantz HDAM-SA2 amplifier modules, as found in our flagship Reference Series CD players and amplifiers. Selected components are also used throughout the audio signal path, for the very best reproduction of your music. A centralised CD mechanism, able to play MP3, WMA and AAC files as well as standard CDs, is also used for ultra-accurate disc-reading and, along with its analogue audio outputs, optical and coaxial digital connections are provided, allowing the HD-CD1 to be connected directly to the HD-AMP1's ultra-high-quality digital-to-analogue conversion. The HD-CD1 also features the stylish MusicLink design, with a solid aluminium front panel, double-layer chassis for vibration isolation, and retro-style side panels, and also includes a high-quality integral headphone amplifier with adjustable gain to drive high-end headphones for personal listening and comes complete with a remote control for all its functions, also able to 'drive' a complete system of HD-CD1 and HD-AMP1. It's a superb Marantz CD player - in miniature!",

                    "description": "Creek Evo was in at the start of CD, launching its first player — the original CD-63 — in 1982. In the following years, Marantz became well known as the CD-Player specialist. Drawing on the development process for the flagship SA-10, and designed by the same team, the SA-12 Special Edition was created to celebrate the love of music and exalt the mastery and emotion of music. Marantz Musical Mastering technology defines new standards in the digital and analogue audio processing. A disc mechanism built purely for audio, the “SACDM-3” is able to play SACDs, CDs, and compilations on CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. It also has an asynchronous USB input, able to handle formats all the way up to PCM/DXD 384kHz/32bit and DSD11.2MHz. The Marantz Musical Mastering Stream transforms all PCM file formats to DSD format, using advanced filtering and proprietary processing before the Marantz Musical Mastering Conversion converts the 1-bit data stream directly into an analogue signal without the use of a conventional D/A converter. The Marantz engineering team created this player to deliver the kind of sound able to bring you closer than ever to your favourite music. The reason is simple, and central to everything Marantz does — because music matters.",

During recent renovations, receipts were found from Nicolson’s Gramophone Saloon dating back to 1926. In the 1950s WG Graham took over the shop and renamed it WG Graham’s Hi-Fi Corner. Upon his retirement, Graham Tiso bought the business and shortened the name to Hi-Fi Corner.  ",
